                            <p> I'm Christine, a postdoctoral researcher at NOAA Fisheries - Alaska Fisheries Science Center. I'm currently constructing an individual-based model for Alaskan snow crab (<i>Chinoecetes opilio</i>><>) populations to predict impacts of ocean acidification and climate change on this species. I recently completed my PhD at the University of Washington in the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM) program. I worked with Tim Essington in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences to identify how and why somatic growth in marine groundfish varies and how this variation affects population productivity and fisheries management. I'm broadly interested in fisheries population dynamics and stock assessment and how these may be impacted by changing ocean conditions. Throughout my PhD work I was able to explore these questions more through collaborations via the <a href="http://seagrant.noaa.gov/fundingfellowships/nmfssgfellowship.aspx">NMFS/Sea Grant Population Dynamics Fellowship</a> program and the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/igertpoc/">NSF IGERT Program on Ocean Change</a>. I'd be happy to talk to you about my research, the QERM program at UW, or life as a quantitative ecologist and/or fisheries scientist in general; email is the best way to contact me. </p></td>

At UVa I majored in Systems Engineering, with a focus on computer systems, and spent my summers working as a developer and database administrator.  After college, I moved to Seattle to work in tech for three years and fell in love with the Pacific Northwest.  While here, my interest in environmental issues and the marine ecosystem became more and more of a full-time passion and less of a hobby.  So, it was an easy choice to attend graduate school in the QERM program, which was a perfect fit for my interests and skill set. After completing my PhD, I moved over to the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, to maintain my easy bike commute (and also study cool Alaskan crabs). I've volunteered at the <a href="http://www.seattleaquarium.org/">Seattle Aquarium</a>, as a judge with the <a href="http://www.nosb.org">National Ocean Sciences Bowl</a>, and with the <a href="http://www.oceaninquiry.org">Ocean Inquiry Project</a>. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, cycling, scuba diving, snowboarding, and traveling.</p>

                                I'm working on an individual-based model (using the DisMELS framework) to predict how anticipated changes in ocean pH and temperatures will affect Alaska snow crab (<i>Chinoecetes opilio</i>) in the Bering Sea. The model incorporates stage-structure and spatial considerations, and we plan to combing modeled impacts on larval through juvenile stages of crab from experimental results with output from a regional ocean model of the Bering Sea that provides fine-resolution projections of changing pH and temperature.

                                    I'm working with an interdisciplinary group of IGERT Program on Ocean Change students, including economic, atmospheric, and natural scientists, to qualitatively evaluate the level of adaptation to sea level rise being undertaken in a small number of US coastal cities. We are particularly interested in the role of science in informing plans to adapt to sea level rise and creating recommendations for how physical scientists can make their products more applicable to planning. A smaller part of the project is evaluating how far along each city plan has come and identifying key attributes of the governance systems in each location that contribute to successful incorporating of science and risk analyses. This work is ongoing.
