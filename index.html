                            <p> I'm Christine, a PhD candidate in the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM) program. I work with Tim Essington in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. My dissertation work focuses on identifying how and why somatic growth in marine groundfish varies and how this variation affects population productivity and fisheries management. More broadly, I'm interested in how variation in demographic processes affects the outcome of population models and how abiotic and biotic factors induce this variation. More broadly I'm interested in fisheries stock assessment and ocean change, which I've been able to explore through collaborations as part of the <a href="http://seagrant.noaa.gov/fundingfellowships/nmfssgfellowship.aspx">NMFS/Sea Grant Population Dynamics Fellowship</a> program and the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/igertpoc/">NSF IGERT Program on Ocean Change</a>. I'd be happy to talk to potential graduate students about the QERM program; email is the best way to contact me. </p></td>

At UVa I majored in Systems Engineering, with a focus on computer systems, and spent my summers working as a developer and database administrator.  After college, I moved to Seattle to work in tech for three years and fell in love with the Pacific Northwest.  While here, my interest in environmental issues and the marine ecosystem became more and more of a full-time passion and less of a hobby.  So, it was an easy choice to attend graduate school in the QERM program, which was a perfect fit for my interests and skill set. I've volunteered at the <a href="http://www.seattleaquarium.org/">Seattle Aquarium</a>, as a judge with the <a href="http://www.nosb.org">National Ocean Sciences Bowl</a>, and with the <a href="http://www.oceaninquiry.org">Ocean Inquiry Project</a>. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, cycling, scuba diving, snowboarding, and traveling.</p>

                                    <br/><i><b>what is the ecological impact of seafood mislabeling?</b></i><br/>
                                    As part of the SAFS <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/safsdrby/">Research Derby</a>, a high-speed, collaborative research event, I worked with a group of four students to develop a simulation study assessing how mislabeling of seafood can affect the marine environment. We conducted a meta-analysis of DNA barcoding studies, as well as compiling unpublished and FDA public data, to determine which fish are commonly substituted for other fish in restaurants. We then use a simulation of consumer behavior to estimate which fish are being consumed when different fish are ordered to see if, in general, substituted seafood items are more or less sustainable than the ordered item. This work is ongoing.
                                    <br/><br/><i><b>petrale sole stock assessment update</b></i><br/>
                                    I worked with a number of graduate students and NOAA employees Owen Hamel and Melissa Haltuch to update the stock assessment model for West Coast petrale sole and sablefish. This has included using Stock Synthesis 3 to fit the model, and working up and adding the most recent years of index and composition data. Next, we performed model tuning and evaluated the sensitivity of output management reference points to a number of different model assumptions. We presented the outcomes of these stock assessments at the June meeting of the Pacific Fishery Management Council in Spokane, WA on June 10th, and our recommendations were accepted by the SSC. 
                                    <br/><br/><i><b>using ss3sim to evaluate the effect of growth estimation on stock assessments</b></i><br/>
                                    Along with a number of students and associated researchers, I worked on a simulation study using the ss3sim R package evaluating how estimation of growth curves affects stock assessment advice. As part of this project, we updated the package and examined three questions: (1) how does binning impact estimation of management quantities and performance? (2) how does internal vs. external estimation of a somatic growth curve impact estimated quantities? and (3) how does using empirical weight-at-age to model growth compare to using a constant growth curve? 
                                    <br/><br/><i><b>climate adaptation planning in coastal cities</b></i><br/>
                                    I'm working with an interdisciplinary group of IGERT Program on Ocean Change students, including economic, atmospheric, and natural scientists, to qualitatively evaluate the level of adaptation to sea level rise being undertaken in a small number of US coastal cities. We are particularly interested in the role of science in informing plans to adapt to sea level rise and creating recommendations for how physical scientists can make their products more applicable to planning. A smaller part of the project is evaluating how far along each city plan has come and identifying key attributes of the governance systems in each location that contribute to successful incorporating of science and risk analyses. This work is ongoing.
